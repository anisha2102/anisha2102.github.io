    title: Research
    intro: >
      My research focuses on making robotics and cyberphysical systems
      safe, and improving the quality assurance of these systems. For this
      purpose I have done a number of empirical studies that identifies the
      challenges and bottlenecks of automated testing in robotics. In addition,
      I have developed tools and benchmarks towards building an automated testing
      pipeline for robotic systems.

      In addition, over the years I have also worked on automatic program repair,
      where given a faulty program and a set of test cases (some of which are failing),
      patches are automatically generated in a way that the final program passes
      all the test cases.

    assignments:
      - title: Robotics Quality Assurance
        #link: "#hook"
        tagline: "In this project, we discover and develop powerful methods to
        automatically detect, localize and fix defects in real-world
        autonomous systems using low-fidelity, software-based simulation."

      - title: SOSRepair
        link: "https://github.com/squaresLab/SOSRepair"
        tagline: "Automatic program repair tool which generates high quality
        patches by replacing the buggy fragment of code with a correct
        implementation that is already written by developers
        in maybe some other project."

      - title: CoBlox
        link: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVQLQhVWdHg"
        tagline: "In this project, with inspiration from block-based
        programming languages, initially designed as an introductory
        programming environment for education, we created CoBlox,
        a block-based interface for programming a one-armed industrial robot."
